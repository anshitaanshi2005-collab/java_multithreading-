# java_multithreading-
A simple Java project demonstrating multithreading by simulating a password discovery process. This educational project shows how threads can work together to find lowercase and uppercase characters in a password and combine their results using a shared data structure.
🚀 Features

Multithreading: Parallel search for lowercase and uppercase characters.

Shared Data Structure: Uses an ArrayList<Character> for storing results.

Runnable Interface: Threads implement Runnable for flexibility.

Password Reconstruction: Combines thread results to display the complete password.

Console Visualization: Shows thread activity during the search process.
